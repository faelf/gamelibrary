# Game Library

## Overview

This is a personal project to track my gaming collection.

The goal is to expand the app over time to include features like tracking purchase dates, completion status, and generating statistics about my gaming habits. This project demonstrates ongoing learning and development with JavaScript, Bootstrap, and optionally Firebase for cloud storage.
